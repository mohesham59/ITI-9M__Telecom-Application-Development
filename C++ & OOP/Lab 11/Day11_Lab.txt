1- in "GeoShape" example, do changes required to overcome "Square & Circle Problems of setting different dim values":
	- try "protected inheritance", 



2- Composition Example: Point, Rect, Circle, Line + drawing graphics.
	- each class should have: attributes, constructors, setters & getters, Draw()



3- in "GeoShape" example, do changes required to:
	- prevent anyone from creating object of shape class "make it abstract, 
	- try using "pure virtual function: CalcArea()"


4- Continue on last day assignment (Base-Derived-DerivedJunior):
	- try to create pointer from each parent, and points to every object from child (try to access member data and call member functions and see what happens) 



Bonus:
-------
	- Lamp 



Note: 
	- Students should Trace the code by F7 or F8 to see the sequence of calling of constructors.
	- Check graphics settings on CodeBlocks
