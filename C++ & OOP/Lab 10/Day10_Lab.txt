1- in "Complex Operator Overloading" example, add Casting Operator overloading "(int)C1":

int X = (int) C1


----------------------------------------------------------------------

2- Base/Derived classes:

class Base
	- private members x
	- "protected" member y
	- constructors & destructor
	- setters & getters
	- function sum (return summation of x and y)

class Derived
	- private members z
	- constructors & destructor
	- setters & getters
	- override function sum in Derived to add functionality to the Base sum function:
	(return summation of x and y and z)
	
class Derived_Junior
	- private members m
	- constructors & destructor
	- setters & getters
	- override function sum in Derived_Junior to add functionality to the Derived sum function:
	(return summation of x and y and z and m)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

3- Class GeoShape:

class GeoShape
	- private members dim1, dim2
	- constructors & destructor
	- setters & getters
	- function CalcArea(return 0)	

	- then we have to create 4 derived classes (Rectangle, Square, Circle, Triangle) 
	  in which they inherit from Shape base class.
	- override function CalcArea in these derived classes to calculate area according to each shape	



Note: Students should Trace the code by F7 or F8 to see the sequence of calling of constructors of Base and Derived.
