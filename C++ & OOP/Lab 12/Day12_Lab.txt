1- Continue on last day assignment (Base-Derived-DerivedJunior) example:
- try the following:
	- create pointer from base points to object from derived "call derived function using base pointer"
	- use "virtual" keyword, then try again to see what is the difference



2- in "GeoShape" example, do changes required to:
	- make another function called "sumOfAllShapesArea", that takes 4 shapes and return sum of these shapes areas.



3- Continue on last day assignment:
- Composition Example: Point, Rect, Circle, Line + drawing graphics.
	- each class should have: attributes, constructors, setters, Draw()
 
- Aggregation Example: Picture, Point, Rect, Circle, Line + graphics.
	- class Picture should have: attributes, constructors, setters, Paint()
	- set color in (Rect, Circle, Line) before drawing.


4- Continue the Picture Example:
      - Write new class Shape with variable color + setters and getters.. Rect, Circle, and Line to Inherit from it.
      - in class Shape Make function "Draw( )", a pure virtual function, then make necessary changes to other classes.
      - Simplify the Picture class, so as to only be constructed by an array of Shapes (array of pointers to Shape), 
	then use the pointer of base class to call the Draw( ) function of Circle, Rect, and Line.



Bonus:
======
- Draw "jagged Array" of shapes...
