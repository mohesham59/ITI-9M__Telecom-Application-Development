Welcome to my GitHub repository documenting my journey as part of the **Information Technology Institute (ITI) Scholarship** in the **Telecom Application Development track**.

This repository serves as a dynamic reflection of my learning progress, projects, and technical growth throughout the program. It is intended to be a living portfolio that evolves alongside my skills and knowledge.

## Purpose

This repository is designed to:

- Track learning milestones and progress during the ITI scholarship  
- Provide a structured reference for the concepts, tools, and technologies I study  
- Showcase practical application of learned skills  
- Serve as a professional portfolio demonstrating continuous development  

## Approach

Rather than presenting fixed content, this repository is built to:

- Grow incrementally as I advance through the program  
- Incorporate new tools, topics, and projects  
- Maintain organized and clear documentation  
- Emphasize practical understanding over theoretical memorization
